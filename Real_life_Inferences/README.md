# Social Momentum Navigation

This project implements the **Social Momentum (SM) algorithm**, inspired by the work of **Mavrogiannis et al. (2022)**, titled:

> "Social Momentum: Design and Evaluation of a Framework for Socially Competent Robot Navigation"
> *(See `Mavrogiannis et al. - 2022 - Social Momentum Design and Evaluation of a Framework for Socially Competent Robot Navigation.pdf` in this directory.)*

The **goal** of this project is to develop a **Python-based simulation** of the Social Momentum algorithm, which enables **legible generation of navigation behavior of humans and robots in indoor environments** by optimizing **angular momentum-based collision avoidance**.
